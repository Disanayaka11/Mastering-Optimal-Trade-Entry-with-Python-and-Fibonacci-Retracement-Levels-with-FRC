Dominate the Forex market with ICT's powerful trading strategy.

## Overview

This guide will help you master the powerful Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) technique used by the legendary Inner Circle Trader (ICT). We'll use Python and Fibonacci retracement levels to time your trades like a Wall Street pro.

## Key Concepts

- **Fibonacci retracement levels**: Widely used by traders to identify potential support and resistance levels where the price may reverse (Chen, 2021).
- **Python and `yfinance` library**: We'll use Python and the `yfinance` library to fetch historical price data for a Forex pair and identify key support and resistance levels.
- **Local minima and maxima**: We'll find local minima and maxima in the price data to determine significant low and high points (Jones et al., 2001; Rehman, 2021).
- **Waiting for price retracements**: Monitor the Fibonacci retracement levels and execute trades when the price reaches these levels to capitalize on potential reversals and maximize trading profits.

## Important Note

Always use proper risk management and set stop-loss orders to protect your trading capital (Pardo, 2019).
